The regular expression /^\d+$/ is used to check if the card number contains only digits.

Here's a breakdown of the regex pattern:

'^' asserts the start of the string.
'\d' matches any digit (0-9).

'+' matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern (in this case, \d).
'$' asserts the end of the string.
So, the pattern /^\d+$/ ensures that the entire string consists of one or more digits, effectively checking for the absence of any non-digit characters in the card number.

Using this regular expression, the program validates that the card number is composed solely of digits before validating the card number's checksum.
